          <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Front-end development focuses on creating the
            visual aspects and interactive elements of a website or web
            application that users interact with directly.
          </p>
          <h3>Technologies:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> The foundation
              of web pages, used to structure content and define elements such
              as headings, paragraphs, and links.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> Controls the look
              and layout of the website, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Adds interactivity and dynamic
              features to websites, such as animations, form validation, and
              responsive elements.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
          <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Back-end development handles the server-side
            of web development, managing the data and server interactions that
            drive the functionality of a website or application.
          </p>
          <h3>Technologies:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Server-Side Languages:</strong> Languages like PHP,
              Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js are used to create the logic that
              processes user requests, manages sessions, and interacts with
              databases.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Databases:</strong> Store and manage data used by the
              website. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Server Management:</strong> Involves setting up and
              maintaining servers that host the website or application, ensuring
              they run smoothly and securely.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="box">
          <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Full-stack developers are proficient in both
            front-end and back-end development. They handle all aspects of web
            development, from designing user interfaces to managing server-side
            processes and databases.
          </p>
          <h3>Importance:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Versatility:</strong> Full-stack developers have a
              comprehensive understanding of the entire web development process,
              allowing them to build complete web applications and troubleshoot
              issues across both front-end and back-end.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Efficiency:</strong> They streamline the development
              process by integrating both front-end and back-end elements,
              ensuring that the different components of a web application work
              seamlessly together.
